# Piggy Bank

I wanted to track my expenses, but the available apps have too many bells and whistles for my liking. 
Thus, I created my own super simple piggy bank app with Flutter.

Features:
* Supports tracking of income/expenses.
* SQL database stores the transaction amounts.
* Line plot shows the change of balance over time.
* No asset requirements.
